                      O, what a pretty little book
                        So full of pictures too;
                    I should like through it to look.
                       I'll buy it--wouldn't you?

 Three wise men of Gotham
 Went to sea in a bowl;
 And if the bowl had been stronger,
 My song had been longer.

                 [Illustration - Beggers face to face]

 Hark! hark! the dogs do bark,
   The beggars have come to town;
 Some in rags, and some in tags,
   And some in velvet gowns.

 Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
 Stole a pig, and away he run;
     The pig was eat,
     And Tom was beat,
 And Tom ran crying down the street.

                        [Illustration - Horse]

 I had a little hobby horse,
   And it was dapple gray;
 His head was made of oat-straw,
   His tail was made of clay.
 He could amble, he could trot,
 He could carry a mustard-pot
 Through the town of Woodstock,
   Hey, boys, hey!

   Rain, rain, go away,
   Come again, April day;
   Little Johnny wants to play
   In the meadow on the hay.

                         [Illustration - Cock]

 The little black dog ran round the house,
   And set the bull a roaring,
 And drove the monkey to the boat,
   Who set the oars a rowing,
 And scar'd the cock upon the rock,
   Who cracked his throat with crowing.

                         [Illustration - Bell]

 Ding dong bell, the cat's in the well.
 Who put her in? Little Johnny Green.
 Who pulled her out? Great Jack Stout.
   What a naughty boy was that,
   To drown poor pussy cat,
 Who never did him any harm,
 And killed the mice in his father's barn.

                    [Illustration - Boy with Book]

   Little lad, little lad,
   Where were you born?
 Far off in Lancaster, under a thorn.
 I'm the stoutest boy you ever did see,
 I can carry a pocket-book bigger than me.

                    *       *       *       *       *

 How many miles to Babylon?
 Threescore miles and ten.
 Can I get there by candle-light?
 Yes, and back again.
